This is a project hoping to measure brain activity with a DIY EEG device that currently utilizes three electrodes. An Arduino Uno is used to collect the data and send it to the serial port.

TODO:
 - Data collection from batch script to csv file
 - high-pass filter above .1-.5 hz
 - low-pass filter below 50 hz

INFO:
- Delta waves:
    Frequency range: 0 Hz to 4 Hz
    High levels: Brain injuries, learning problems, inability to think, severe ADHD
    Low levels: Inability to rejuvenate body, inability to revitalize the brain, poor sleep
    Optimal range: Healthy immune system,  restorative REM sleep
- Theta waves:
    Frequency range: 4 Hz to 8 Hz
    High levels: ADHD or hyperactivity, depressive states, impulsive activity or inattentiveness
    Low levels: Anxiety symptoms, poor emotional awareness, higher stress levels
    Optimal range: Maximum creativity, deep emotional connection with oneself and others, greater intuition, relaxation
- Alpha waves: 
    Frequency range: 8 Hz to 12 Hz
    High levels: Too much daydreaming, over-relaxed state or an inability to focus
    Low levels: OCD, anxiety symptoms, higher stress levels
    Optimal range: Ideal relaxation
- Beta waves: 
    Frequency range: 12 Hz to 40 Hz
    High levels: Anxiety, inability to feel relaxed, high adrenaline levels, stress
    Low levels: Depression, poor cognitive ability, lack of attention
    Optimal range: Consistent focus, strong memory recall, high problem solving ability
- Gamma waves:
    Frequency range: 40 Hz to 100 Hz
    High levels: Anxiety, stress
    Low levels: Depression, ADHD, learning issues
    Optimal range: Information processing, cognition, learning, binding of senses
